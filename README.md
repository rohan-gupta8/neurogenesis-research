# Neurogenesis Research
Computational spatial model of the olfactory bulb with capability for neurogenesis (new neuron placement)

# Description

Using a computational model of the olfactory bulb (due to David Kersen) with some biological/biophysical simplifications to generate networks of Mitral and Granule cells.

Neurogenesis modeled to maximise a variety of odor differentiation/identification factors using objective functions in graph theory and information theory
