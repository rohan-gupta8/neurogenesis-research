# Neurogenesis Research
Computational spatial model of the olfactory bulb with capability for neurogenesis (new neuron placement)

# Description

Using a computational model of the olfactory bulb with some biological/biophysical simplifications to generate networks of Mitral and Granule cells.

Neurogenesis modeled to maximise objective functions in graph theory/information theory and validated using unsupervised/Hebbian learning to achieve maximal odor differentiation (and higher order properties)
