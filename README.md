# Neurogenesis Research
Computational spatial model of the olfactory bulb with capability for neurogenesis (new neuron placement)

# Description

Using a computational model of the olfactory bulb (due to David Kersen) with some biological/biophysical simplifications to generate networks of Mitral and Granule cells.

Study modes of neuron placement through functional methods like activity-based granule cell selection, and structural methods using properties of the bipartite graph.
